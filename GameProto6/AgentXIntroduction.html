    <p><B>Director Grizzly: </B> Greetings, Agents. We have a priority one
      situation: We’ve lost track of Agent X. Agent X is one of our best
      agents, and if a problem is dangerous enough that they couldn’t
      handle it, it could be a threat to the entire multiverse. Because
      Agent X uniquely exists in multiple different dimensions at once,
      locating them conventionally is impossible.
