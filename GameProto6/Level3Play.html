    <h1>Level 3- Play</h1>
    <p> Read the following Directions aloud, and make sure everyone understands them.
        Starting with Player 1, everyone takes a turn to describe a memory they have that surrounds
        their Object Gamma—without describing the object itself. The describing Player has 60
        seconds to recount their memory.
        The other Players then have 60 seconds to individually decide two possibilities about the object
        based on this memory: <ol>
        <li>An emotion that comes to mind when hearing the memory recounted—how did the story
        make you feel?</li>
        <li>What fantastic contraption or object that might reproduce that same emotion in their Agent's universe.</li>
        Record each players guess of a feeling and contraption here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><input id="feeling1" placeholder = "Player 1 feeling"></li>
            <li><input id="contraptionM1" placeholder = "Player 1 contraption"></li>
            <li><input id="feeling2" placeholder = "Player 2 feeling"></li>
            <li><input id="contraptionM2" placeholder = "Player 2 contraption"></li>
            <li><input id="feeling3" placeholder = "Player 3 feeling"></li>
            <li><input id="contraptionM3" placeholder = "Player 3 contraption"></li>
