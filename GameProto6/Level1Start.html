      <b>Doctor Polybius: </b> Agent X is not like most of our agents. They are
      aware of their own multidimensionality, and they are able to move between
      worlds. They don’t have control over this power; they shift when
      dimensional tides or energies carry them away, but they’ve learned to ride
      these tides like a surfer on a wave. It’s remarkable, honestly.
