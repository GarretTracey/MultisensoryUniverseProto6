    <h1>Level 2- Play</h1>

<p>Starting with Player 1, everyone takes a turn to a) turn off their camera, and b) manipulate their
    Object Beta to make an audible sound. They should repeat this for a total of 10 seconds.
    The other Players then have 60 seconds to individually decide two possibilities about the object
    based on this sound: <ol>
    <li> A verb (ending in “-ing”) that describes how the sound was made </li>
   <li>What fantastic contraption or object might make that sound in their universe.</li>
    Record each players decisions here:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><input id="verbS1" placeholder = "Player 1 verb ending in 'ing'"></li>
        <li><input id="contraptionS1" placeholder = "Player 1 contraption"></li>
        <li><input id="verbS2" placeholder = "Player 2 verb ending in 'ing'"></li>
