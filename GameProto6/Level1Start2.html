      <b>Doctor Polybius: </b> Through the years, Agent X has gained a
      reputation as an unorthodox investigator. In our dimension they may be
      following some seemingly mundane and unconnected task—eating from a bowl
      that isn’t there, straining to hear sounds no one else can, or recalling
      memories from a life they never lived. Meanwhile in another reality Agent
      X’s counterpart braves a hurricane to reach the ancient library that’s
      home to a spell-casting robot chef!
