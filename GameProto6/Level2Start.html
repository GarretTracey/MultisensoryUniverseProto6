      <b> Director Grizzly: </b> Agent X isnâ€™t the only person to exist in more
      than one world. There is another, a malevolent entity we know as Crucius,
      who moves across the multiverse like a blight. Where Agent X has learned
      to ride the waves of dimensional energy, Crucius is Typhoon and Tyrant
      both, causing chaos across worlds and using that chaos for their own cruel
      ends. Agent X had fought them before, but this time, Crucius was ready,
      pulling Agent X into their trap to remove them as opposition once and for
      all.
