    <p>
      Agent X in the Multisensory Universe is an interactive storytelling game
      that has players incorporate real life objects into the creation of a
      story. Each player will find 3 household items before the game:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Object alpha </b>- any object that you associate with an action,
        place, or time of day.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Object Beta </b>- an object that has a distinctive sound. Either it
        generates sound or makes a noise when otherwise manipulated (tapped,
        crinkled, dropped, etc.), or both. Pick an object that makes a loud
        enough sound to be picked up by a mic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Object Gamma </b>- any object that is attached to a specific personal
        memory—something where you can clearly recall a moment in time and the
        circumstances that surround it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At each stage of the game, players will have to guess what your object is
      based on various hints based on their primary characteristic. These
      guesses will contribute to the final generation of Agent X’s adventure!
