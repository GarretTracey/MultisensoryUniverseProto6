    <h1>Level 1- Play!</h1>
<p> Remember, your alpha item is:<p id="alphaPlay"></p> </p>
    
 <p>Read the following directions aloud, and make sure everyone understands them.
  Starting with Player 1, everyone takes a turn to act out a description of their Object Alpha in
  10 seconds, using only mime.</p>
  
 <p> The other Players then have 60 seconds to collectively decide three possibilities about the
  object based on this performance: <ol>
  <li> A verb that describes its use (ending in 'ing') </li>
  <li>A location it would likely be used </li>
  <li>Amount of time spent using the object </li>
  Record the teams answers here:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li> <input id="verb" placeholder="verb ending in 'ing'"></input></li>
    <li> <input id="location" placeholder="location"></input></li>
    <li> <input id="time" placeholder="time"></input></li>
